Being that Ruby on Rails is still used for most companies to date, I decided to give myself a slight advantage and learn Ruby code along with ROR. I am surprised and amazed at the subtleties that make ROR a much more convenient framework than Django (which just seems a bit too hard for me at the time) and also more robust than Flask.
